## Overview

`Unholy mess` is a project management software. It aims to help to provide
an overview of current plans for a project, current activities, subprojects and rationale behind them.

Several points I hope to implement are: 
* Ability to view projects on different level of details, e.g. switch between week plans and half-year plans easily.   
* Clearly show project-subproject relation to see where the subprojects belong
in the project big picture.   
* Generate to-do list for a day; integrate a tool like Pomodoro timer to facilitate execution.  
* Emphasise analysis of projects outcomes.
